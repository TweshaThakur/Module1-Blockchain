Blockchain Python Project
This project demonstrates the creation of a basic blockchain using Python. The blockchain is implemented with a proof-of-work mechanism, and a Flask web application is used to interact with the blockchain. Users can mine new blocks, retrieve the blockchain, and check its validity.

Features
Blockchain Creation: Implements a basic blockchain with proof-of-work consensus.
Mining Blocks: Provides an endpoint to mine new blocks and add them to the blockchain.
Blockchain Integrity: Ensures the validity and security of the blockchain through hashing and proof verification.
Flask Web API: Allows interaction with the blockchain through a simple web interface.
